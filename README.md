# PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED
The main problems that I ran into were making the model schema for my users, posts, and comments. At first, I had many to many relations, when I only needed one to many, so I had to fix those models and change other parts of my code accordingly. Another problem, or feature that I had trouble implementing was the comments for each post. I wanted them to be sorted chronologically, but also have the top three most liked comments at the top. It was difficult getting the top three liked comments and also making the rest of the comments array hold the rest of the comments in chronological order.

# FAVORITE PARTS
My favorite part was probably the comments and styling them. I was pretty satisfied when I styled my comment section to resemble the comment section from other big websites such as youtube or instagram. I also had fun with express and writing "if" statements to make sure the user doesn't do things that they shouldn't be able to do.
